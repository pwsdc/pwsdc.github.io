# Club Introduction
Welcome to the club! We elaborated a little bit about each of the topics on the schedule. We posted an announcement on our [Discord](/join#discord) server that includes the flyer, so feel free to check it out if you missed this meeting!

# Using AI Responsibly
We went over [PennWest's AI policies](https://www.pennwest.edu/_resources/docs/about/policies/ac072-ai-acceptable-use.pdf) (pdf) -- in short, don't use it to cheat, since it's considered plaigarism. You can use it to help learn or do research, but copying it directly is not fair game.

To show off the fun quirks of how AI can hallucinate false information, we played a game of chess against it, playing any move it gives -- which, you may be able to guess, are [not always legal moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_ZuO1fHefo&pp=ygUUY2hhdHBndCB2cyBzdG9ja2Zpc2g%3D) (video). 

# Next Week
Next Wednesday we'll be focusing on group collaboration using Git and Github! If you want to get ahead (and you haven't done these already), you can [download and install Git on your device](https://git-scm.com/downloads), as well as [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) and [download/install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).
