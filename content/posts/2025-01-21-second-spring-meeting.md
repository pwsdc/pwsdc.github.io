# Pointers in C
Club started out with a [video by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NszbIerYc) that covers the basics of pointers in C as well as a singly-linked list.

We also went over an interesting [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06942v2) detailing why arrays are typically advantageous over linked lists in everyday use.
# List of Languages for LOTW
We'll have a thread open in our discord for submitting any languages you want to see used for Language of the Week this semester!

Every two weeks or so, we'll choose a random language from the list to use during any leetcode/little coding sessions to get to know a variety of languages. 
# Next Week
As we prepare for the club fair this week, we'll hopefully be continuing the fun discussions! Same time, day, and place as usual (5-6 PM, Tuesday, Eberly 110).
