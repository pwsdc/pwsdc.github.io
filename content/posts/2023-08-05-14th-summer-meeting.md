# Discussions

## Discussions with Professor Chen on Zoom on 8/5

We updated Professor Chen on the status of the club.

Professor Chen agreed that an (unofficial) rename to "Software Development Club" could be a good move in attracting more members or at least wouldn't hurt.

We told Professor Chen about the dire membership issues and about our plans for next semester's content including
- Presentations on various technologies
    - eg, Code Linting, Linux Dual Boot, JavaScript, GitHub, Docker
- Speeches by Alumni

We asked Professor Chen about getting a faculty advisor from the CIT Program. He had suggested Professor Menon. None of the board had taken a class with her, but, prior to this meeting, we asked students from the CIT program about her and she was highly recommended. The board has agreed to reach out to her.
- Karl will email Professor Menon and CC Professor Chen

Professor Chen suggested some additional speakers:
- Students who have made games for their senior projects, and their process in game design
- Prof. Chen would be willing to personally talk about Cybersecurity as well as he teaches some masters level Cybersecurity courses
- Prof. Chen suggested reaching out to previous club members about speaking to the club

Professor Chen had an email from a merchandising company that had supplied the club in the past offering a deal - we will follow up with them about merch this semester.

Professor Chen mentioned the [PACISE](https://www.esu.edu/pacise/) competition. We will start talking about that this semester, though it looks like the competition takes place in the Spring. Professor Chen will send me some past competition stuff.
