# Semester Plans
This semester, we're working towards having more club activities; an incomplete list:
- Code jams
- Language of the Half-Month
	- Spin a spinner with many different languages on it several times, vote on a language, and use/learn that language during Leetcode
- Club fair: not much planned since it's the spring semester
	- Mostly a meet-and-greet
- Play videos at the beginning of meetings to spark discussion
	- Give ideas to people for personal projects
	- Show people the different fields within CS

# Next Week
Next week's meeting will be Tuesday from 5-6 (like usual).
