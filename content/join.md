Welcome! We are glad to have you!

To become a current member of the club, you must attend **at least two meetings or events** in the semester. If you have any extenuating circumstances, let an officer know. 

We ask everyone to join our Discord server, and all current members to join our Engage (more information below).

# Weekly Meetings

The meeting time for the main weekly meeting can be found on the main page [here](/).

We will also hold smaller meetings to cover anything that wasn't done in the main weekly meeting, or simply as an "off-the-cuff" hangout. Times for such meetings will be posted on the Discord.

# Discord

Our Discord server is where information about the club is posted and where communication outside of in-person meetings occur. This is our "central hub" for the club. Here is the link:
