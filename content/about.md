Our mission is to provide a space for everyone interested in any aspect of software development. Yes, that includes **you**! Software development is not just programming, it's design, marketing, business, management, and much more. Meet like-minded people, explore new areas, work together on projects, build friendships that will last a lifetime. 

No matter your interests or experience, we welcome you to [join the club](/join)!

# What We Offer

To facilitate our mission, we offer several opportunities to get involved:

* **Weekly Meetings**
  * Weekly meetings are held at least once a week during the Fall and Spring semesters at PennWest California. 
    * In-person meetings are also available virtually via Discord voice chat (let an officer know if you intend on attending virtually).
  * Weekly meetings are for exploration, experimentation, and discussion with others in a relaxed environment. 
  * Some activities we've done include exploration of topics, coding challenge problems, field trips, workshops, and games/contests.
* **Events**
  * We aim to have at least one event during each semester. These will be on a larger scale than weekly meetings, with the goal of greater exploration and collaboration.
  * An example of an event we've done is a Code Jam, where participants come up with a solution for a given prompt.
  * You have the chance to win prizes!
* **Strong Discord Server**
  * Our Discord server is one of our greatest assets due to its vast network of current students and alumni.
  * If you have any question about software development, there is certainly someone who can answer it or point you in the right direction.
  * We highly recommend exploring the channels and participating in discussion.
  * Feel free to hop in the voice chat with others on the server!
